The P4 application utilizes the custom PHP framework utilized from P2. I modified my P2 microblog project and added the ability to post workouts from a form and follow other user's workouts. 
It utlizes a javascript based workout selection. Users can follow/unfollow other users, update their profile pictures, and add text posts as well.
